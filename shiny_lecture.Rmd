User Interface
-Layout, Theme, Widgets
-Widgets: collect information from the user (i.e. selection/input) that will be used to update outputs created in the server like...
    - Dropdown selection
    - Radio Buttons/Checkboxes
    - Slider bars

Reactivity Into: (for our purposes today)
- In user interface: make a choice --> widget gets info from user --> |update df used to create outputs based on user choice --> create updated outputs from new df| --> and put that ouput in UI
    - |in server|

Our Reactivity Today:
1.) IN UI: make a widget that has a name (inputID)
2.) In Server: use that inputID to create a reactive subset of data
3.) In Server: make a names output (e.g. graph/table) using reactive subset
4.) In UI: call the reactive output to make it appear
